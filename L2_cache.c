/************************************************************

  This file contains the code for the L2 cache. It is a 32KB, 32B, 
  8 Way set associative with Write Back, Look Through mechanisms, 
  and LRU Counter as its replacement policy

   Given cache line size = 32B = 16 words per cache line
   32KB = 16K Words = 1K cache lines = 128 sets
   
   Each cache line has: valid bit, reference bit, dirty bit,
                        tag, and cache-line data.

    An address is decomposed as follows (from lsb to msb):
    2 bits are used for byte offset within a word (bits 0-1)
    4 bits are used for word offset within a cache line (bits 2-5)
    7 bits are used for the set index, since there are 128 sets per cache (bits 6-12).
    19 bits remaining are used as the tag (bits 13-31)

   Therefore, 32-bit address is decomposed as follows:

          19             7            4        2
    ------------------------------------------------
   |     tag      |     set      | word   |  byte  |
   |              |    index     | offset | offset |
    ------------------------------------------------

   Each cache entry is structured as follows:

    1 1    3        8      19 
    ------------------------------------------------------
   |v|d|counter|reserved| tag |  16-word cache line data |
    ------------------------------------------------------

This procedure inserts a new cache line into the L2 cache.

The parameters are:

address: 32-bit memory address for the new cache line.

write_data: an array of 32 bytes containing the 
            cache line data to be inserted into the cache.

evicted_writeback_address: a 32-bit output parameter (thus,
          a pointer to it is passed) that, if the cache line
          being evicted needs to be written back to memory,
          should be assigned the memory address for the evicted
          cache line.
          
evicted_writeback_data: an array of 32 bytes that, if the cache 
          line being evicted needs to be written back to memory,
          should be assigned the cache line data for the evicted
          cache line. Since there are 16 words per cache line, the
          actual parameter should be an array of at least 16 words.

status: this in an 8-bit output parameter (thus, a pointer to it is 
        passed).  The lowest bit of this byte should be set to 
        indicate whether the evicted cache line needs to be
        written back to memory or not, as follows:
            0: no write-back required
            1: evicted cache line needs to be written back.


 The cache replacement algorithm uses an LRU counter alogrithm. 
 A cache entry (among the cache entries in the set) is 
 chosen to be written to in the following order of preference:
    - valid bit = 0
    - counter value is lowest
